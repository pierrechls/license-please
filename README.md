# licence-please

> Simple CLI to easily generate a LICENCE file

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierrechls/licence-please/master/assets/preview.gif)

Open source licenses grant **permission** to everyone to **use**, **modify**, and share licensed project for any purpose, subject to conditions preserving the provenance and **openness** of the project. I decided to create a command line to **quickly** generate a licence file (for a given year and name).

## :rocket: How to use it

#### Install licence-please as a global package

```bash
$ npm i -g licence-please
```

#### Have fun

```bash
$ licence-please --help            # or -h (see all possibles options)
$ licence-please --list            # or -l (list existing templates)
$ licence-please --force           # or -f (overwrite the existing README file)
$ licence-please --model [model]   # or -m (generate from a license model)
$ licence-please --year [year]     # or -y (year of licence generation)
$ licence-please --name [name]     # or -n (name of author's project)
```
